# StyleGAN

This project contains the code to train a StyleGAN and use it to perform style transfer on a set of videos. The StyleGAN was trained with a dataset of 300 images of Monet's panintings. Then the trained model was used to implement style transfer. Below you can find the url which takes you to the code and also the link to a google drive folder where you can explore the training dataset and the images used for the style transfer.
